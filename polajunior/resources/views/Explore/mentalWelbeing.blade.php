                <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm md:text-base mb-4">
                    At our school, mental wellbeing is a core focus, recognizing that a healthy mind is just as important
                    as academic achievement. We are dedicated to providing a nurturing environment that prioritizes the
                    mental and emotional health of both students and staff, ensuring a supportive space where individuals
                    can thrive.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm md:text-base mb-4">
                    Our approach to mental wellbeing involves various programs and initiatives aimed at promoting
                    self-awareness, resilience, and emotional intelligence. Through workshops, counseling sessions, and
                    peer support groups, we empower students with the tools to manage stress, cope with challenges, and
                    foster healthy relationships.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm md:text-base mb-4">
                    We believe in proactive care, offering resources and support to those who may be struggling with their
                    mental health. Our professional counseling team is always available to provide guidance and create
                    personalized plans to ensure the emotional well-being of every individual.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm md:text-base mb-4">
                    In addition to one-on-one support, we organize mental health awareness campaigns, fostering an open
                    dialogue about the importance of mental health and breaking down the stigma associated with seeking
                    help. By integrating mindfulness practices into the curriculum and promoting balance in academics,
                    extracurricular activities, and personal time, we create a holistic environment for mental growth.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm md:text-base">
                    We invite parents, guardians, and community members to engage in our mental wellbeing initiatives,
                    understanding that mental health is a collaborative effort. Together, we can ensure that our students
                    grow into confident, balanced, and emotionally resilient individuals prepared for the complexities of
                    life.
